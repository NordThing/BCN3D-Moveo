I have uploaded new files with the correct rotation to print the parts. As they are in the original folder you have to rotate them to get them in the right direction.

1M1 - print time - 8h 55min - 0.2mm layer height - 20% infill - 100mm/sec - PLA - Printed in 101.25% to compensate for shrinkage in the plastic

1M2 - print time - 12h 05min - 0.2mm layer height - 20% infill - 225mm/sec - PLA - Printed in 101.25% to compensate for shrinkage in the plastic

1M3 - print time - 4h 05min - 0.2mm layer height - 20% infill - 150mm/sec - PLA - Printed in 101.25% to compensate for shrinkage in the plastic

2M1 - print time - 27h 0min - 0.2mm layer height - 20% infill - 150mm/sec - Support - PLA - Printed in 101.25% to compensate for shrinkage in the plastic

Added STL for pulleys and spacer if you want to print instead and donÂ´t have the parts.
This is the files:
