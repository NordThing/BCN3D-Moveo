I have uploaded new files with the correct rotation to print the parts. As they are in the original folder you have to rotate them to get them in the right direction.

T3M1C - print time - 25 min - 0.2mm layer height - 20% infill - 0% support - 150mm/sec - PLA - Printed in 101.25 in X and Y to compensate for shrinkage in the plastic.
